# Senior-Design
Main Repository for COMET project
## Summary
The purpose of this project is to test and develop a working network testbed utilizing Software Defined Radio (SDR) technologies as the primary means of data communications. The testbed will be the underlying system for further research within the scope of radio communications. The primary goal specified by the customer is to achieve reliable data communications between two systems connected to this network. To do so, the testbed must contain a programmed transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) that is capable of sending and receiving data reliably from one point to another. The range of this communications network must work within the confines of a single enclosed area. 
The Cognitive Radio Multimedia Network Testbed for multimedia communication (COMET) comprises of a network of Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRP) configured to transmit data within the testbed. This is done through the USRP Hardware Driver that allows users on a Windows or Linux System to upload firmware onto the USRPâ€™s RISC softcore microprocessor. The device accommodates many solutions for application development, including open-source platforms such as GNU Radio. This software works with the UHD drivers to provide a high-level design interface for Radio Frequency (RF) applications. This software is easily available on Unix based systems, which provide many needed dependencies missing in the Windows installation.
